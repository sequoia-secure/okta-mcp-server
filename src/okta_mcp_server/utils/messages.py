"""Centralised user-facing confirmation messages for elicitation prompts.

All messages are string templates using ``str.format()`` placeholders so
they can be rendered with resource-specific identifiers at call time.

Keeping them in one place makes future localisation straightforward —
swap this module for a locale-aware loader without touching tool code.
