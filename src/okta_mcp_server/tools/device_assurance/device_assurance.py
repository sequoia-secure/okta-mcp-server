    Use this to audit which device assurance policies exist, compare OS
    version requirements across policies, find policies that do or do not
    block jailbroken/rooted devices, or identify policies whose platform
    requirements may be outdated.

    *** MANDATORY — OS VERSION THRESHOLD QUERIES ***
        Any time the user's request mentions a version number for filtering or
        comparison (e.g. "older than 14.2", "below 14.2.1", "at least 13.x"):

        1. You MUST pass that exact user-supplied string as ``version_threshold``.
           WRONG: list_device_assurance_policies()                         ← bypasses validation
           RIGHT: list_device_assurance_policies(version_threshold="<user value>") ← always pass through
           NEVER call this tool with no arguments and then filter the result
           yourself — that completely bypasses format validation.

        2. If the version is rejected (e.g. because the patch component is
           missing), relay the error word-for-word. STOP and ask the user:
           "What is the exact full version in X.Y.Z format?" Do NOT guess
           or complete the version yourself. Do NOT proceed until the user
           explicitly confirms the full X.Y.Z version.

        3. NEVER guess or infer what the user "probably" meant — always ask.

    IMPORTANT — always call fresh: Never reuse results from a previous call
    to resolve a policy name to an ID. Always call this tool again to get
    an up-to-date list, as policies may have been created or deleted since
    the last call. The response includes a ``retrieved_at`` timestamp — if
    the user references a policy by name that does not appear in a previous
    list, you MUST call this tool again before concluding that the policy
    does not exist.

    IMPORTANT — intermittent empty response: If this tool returns an empty
    list but the user expects policies to exist, call it again — the API
    occasionally returns an empty response on the first call after server
    start. A retry will return the correct data.

    Returns:
        Dict containing:
            - policies (List[Dict]): List of device assurance policy objects.
              Each policy includes a ``status`` field (``ACTIVE``, ``INACTIVE``,
              or ``UNKNOWN`` if the API did not return it). You MUST present this
              field when listing or comparing policies so the user sees the current
              activation state.
            - version_threshold (str, optional): Echo of the validated threshold
              when one was supplied. Use this value for any subsequent filtering
              or comparison in your response.
            - retrieved_at (str): ISO-8601 UTC timestamp of when this list
              was fetched. Use this to detect stale data.
            - note (str): Reminder that the list may become stale and must
              be re-fetched before resolving a policy name to an ID.
            - warning (str): Present if the API returned an unexpected empty
              response; the caller should retry.
            - error (str): Error message if the operation fails.

    Scope/permission errors:
        If the Okta API returns HTTP 401/403 (commonly due to missing OAuth scopes),
        this tool returns ``{"error": "..."}``.
        In that case, present the error message verbatim and STOP — do not retry
        and do not attempt follow-up actions until scopes are fixed.

    Use this to inspect the full configuration of a policy — platform type
    (ANDROID, IOS, MACOS, WINDOWS, CHROMEOS), minimum OS version, disk
    encryption requirements, biometric lock settings, jailbreak/root
    detection, and any other compliance checks configured in the policy.

    IMPORTANT — name-to-ID resolution: This tool requires a policy ID, not a
    name. If the user refers to a policy by name, you MUST call
    list_device_assurance_policies() first to get a FRESH, current list before
    resolving the name to an ID. NEVER resolve a policy name using results
    already present in the conversation — those results may be stale. Even if
    you called list_device_assurance_policies moments ago, call it again: a
    policy may have been created in the Okta UI between that call and now.
    Only after receiving the fresh list may you map the name to an ID and call
    this tool.

    Parameters:
        device_assurance_id (str, required): The ID of the device assurance policy.

    Returns:
        Dict containing the full policy details, or an error dict.

        If the Okta API returns HTTP 401/403 (commonly due to missing OAuth scopes),

    *** MANDATORY RESPONSE FORMAT — YOU MUST FOLLOW THIS EVERY TIME ***
        This tool ALWAYS returns ``"before"``, ``"after"``, and ``"changes"``
        fields. After every successful call you MUST:
        1. Present a formatted before/after comparison table to the user.
        2. For every entry in ``"changes"``, show the attribute name,
           old value, new value, and the ``"implication"`` string.
        3. NEVER reply with just "Done" or a one-line summary.
           The user must see the full comparison — always.
        4. OS VERSION — always use ``user_stated_os_version`` parameter:
           a. Do NOT put osVersion in policy_data — the tool derives it from
              user_stated_os_version after validation.
           b. Set user_stated_os_version to the EXACT characters the user

           c. If user_stated_os_version is rejected, relay the error — STOP and ask:
              "What is the exact full version in X.Y.Z format?"
           d. Do NOT call this tool until the user explicitly states the full
              X.Y.Z version.

    Use this to update minimum OS version requirements, change platform
    compliance settings, or standardise policy configurations across your
    organisation.

    Platform-specific attribute support:
        - ANDROID: name, platform, osVersion, jailbreak (false only), screenLockType
        - IOS: name, platform, osVersion, jailbreak (false only), screenLockType

        - WINDOWS: name, platform, osVersion, diskEncryptionType, screenLockType, secureHardwarePresent
        - CHROMEOS: name, platform, osVersion

    The response ALWAYS includes ``"before"`` and ``"after"`` state comparisons
    plus a ``"changes"`` list with security implications for each modified attribute.
    You MUST present this as a formatted confirmation summary to the user, showing
    exactly what changed and its security implication. Never simply say "Done" —
    always display the before/after comparison table.

    Parameters:
        device_assurance_id (str, required): The ID of the policy to update.
        policy_data (dict, required): The complete updated policy configuration.
            - name (str, required): The policy name.
            - platform (str, required): Target platform.
                One of: ANDROID, IOS, MACOS, WINDOWS, CHROMEOS.
            - osVersion: Do NOT include — use user_stated_os_version instead.
            - diskEncryptionType (dict, optional): Required disk encryption (MACOS, WINDOWS only).
                Format: {\"type\": \"ALL_INTERNAL_VOLUMES\"}
            - secureHardwarePresent (bool, optional): Require secure hardware (MACOS, WINDOWS only).
            - screenLockType (dict, optional): Required screen lock type (ANDROID, IOS, MACOS, WINDOWS).
                Format: {\"include\": [\"BIOMETRIC\"]} or {\"include\": [\"PASSCODE\", \"BIOMETRIC\"]}
                Note: For ANDROID, [\"PASSCODE\"] alone is not valid — must include BIOMETRIC.
            - jailbreak (bool, optional): Block jailbroken/rooted devices (IOS, ANDROID only).
                Note: Currently only accepts false value.
        user_stated_os_version (str, optional): The EXACT OS version string the user
            typed, character-for-character. Required when changing the minimum OS version.
            For ANDROID a single major version (e.g. "12") is accepted.
            For all other platforms X.Y.Z is required — X.Y alone will be rejected.

    Returns:
        Dict containing:
            - before (Dict): Policy state before the update (with securityAttributeStatus).
            - after (Dict): Policy state after the update (with securityAttributeStatus).
            - changes (List[Dict]): List of changed attributes, each with
              attribute name, before/after values, and security implication.
            - error (str): Error message if the operation fails.
